![Perplexity Plot Plot](C:\Users\CarteB\BILLINGS CLINIC\CSI & David Hedges - Same Day Care Project\R\analyses\perplexityPlot_ReasonForVisit.jpeg)

A Latent Dirichlet Analysis was used for exploratory topic modelling. There appear to be approximately 100 different categories for reasons for visit to SDC/EC. The lowest perplexity score was achieved with 97 different groups.

# Sequence and Association Mining

## Status: In Progress

## What is it?

Sequence and Association mining are methods by which events are queried to determine if there is a correlation between them. Sequence mining considers the temporal order of events while association mining is agnoistic to temporal order.
