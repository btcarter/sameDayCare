# NLP & Predicting return from Reason for Visit

![Perplexity Plot Plot](C:\Users\CarteB\BILLINGS CLINIC\CSI & David Hedges - Same Day Care Project\R\analyses\perplexityPlot_ReasonForVisit.jpeg)

A Latent Dirichlet Analysis was used for exploratory topic modelling. There appear to be approximately 100 different categories for reasons for visit to SDC/EC. The lowest perplexity score was achieved with 97 different groups. This has been combined with the dataset for XGBoost.

# XGBoost and opening the black box

For this analysis, only variables know at or close to the time of the original SDC/EC encounter were preserved.

```{r xgboost, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
data.dir.path <- file.path("C:",

# Sequence and Association Mining

## Status: In Progress

## What is it?

Sequence and Association mining are methods by which events are queried to determine if there is a correlation between them. Sequence mining considers the temporal order of events while association mining is agnoistic to temporal order.
